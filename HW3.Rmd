## Rosairi Estevez, HW3 - PSY V0500

## 1. Chris and Isamari 

## Possible Protocol 1 : Roll dice once, if result is 4 then dice is unfair, if it rolls any other number then it is fair. Probability of it to be judged unfair is 1 out of 6 (16.67%), and fair would be 5 out of 6 (83.33%) (This is only using one dice not two)

## Possible Protocol 2 : Roll dice 20 times, if dice results in 6 more than 5 times out of the 20 rolls, then the dice is unfair. The probability of this happening is 1 out of 6 for each of the 20 rolls (3.33%) If getting the number 6 around 5 times from 20 rolls is fairly low, then I would imagine it'd be unusual as well to get 1 more or less than 5, and that goes for 2 more or less, 3, and so on.

## Possible Protocol 3: Roll dice 100 times, if dice results in 6 more than 20 times then it is judged as unfair. (16.67%)


## Experimental Protocol : If dice results in 6 more than 5 times, then the dice is unfair. If dice results in 


# **Modified (unfair) dice (my dice)** = This is the dice I modified, I filed down each side and burned the side with 5 on it. 

```{r}
unfairdice_results <- c(3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 3, 1, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 5, 2, 5, 4, 4)
```

```{r}
if_come_up_6_unfair <- as.numeric(dice_results == 6)
```


True = 1
False = 0 

```{r}
if_come_up_6_unfair
```


```{r}
mean(if_come_up_6_unfair)
```

```{r}
sd(if_come_up_6_unfair)
```

```{r}
summary(if_come_up_6_unfair)
```

```{r}
how_many_rolls <- 20
```

```{r}
t.test(if_come_up_6_unfair)
```

Reject the null hypothesis - false positive, as the p value for the unfair dice data is less than the threshold of significance. Therefore, there is sig. difference in the outcome of the modified dice. 


#**Fair dice** = dice rolls computed by R

```{r}
fairdice_results <- sample(1:6, how_many_rolls, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
fairdice_results
```


```{r}
if_come_up_6_fair <- as.numeric(fairdice_results == 6)

```

True = 1
False = 0 

```{r}
if_come_up_6_fair
```

```{r}
mean(if_come_up_6_fair)
```

```{r}
sd(if_come_up_6_fair)
```

```{r}
summary(if_come_up_6_fair)
```

```{r}
t.test(if_come_up_6_fair)
```

Fail to reject the null - false negative, as the p value is above the significance threshold. Therefore with the fair dice there is no sig. difference in the outcomes of the fair dice.
